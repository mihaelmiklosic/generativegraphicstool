# generative.graphics

An interactive generative art tool built by Mihael Miklošić in April 2025.

This tool lets you create animated noise-based grids and cloth-like structures with customizable layout, noise parameters, shapes, and color palettes.  
You can export your creations as images or videos directly from the browser.

Built using:
- HTML + Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for drawing and animation)

## Features
- Adjustable rows, columns, padding, and offset
- Noise-driven shape distortion (rotation, scale, opacity)
- Switch between rectangles and ellipses
- Predefined and custom color palettes
- Image export (.png) and video export (.webm)

## Running locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser — no installation needed!
